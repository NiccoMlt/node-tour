# node-tour

My personal learning voyage inside NodeJS world.

## Motivation

I never really approached "_real_" JavaScript world before the "[Applicazioni e Servizi Web](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2018/412604)" (_Web applications and services_) course I followed for my degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

When I started approaching Angular ([repo here](https://github.com/NiccoMlt/Angular-Tour-of-Heroes)), the official tutorial was very easy to follow but, when trying to migrate from ```ng serve``` to a "real" server with Express, the absence of a real standard in project structure really confused me.

So I started this basic project to learn the best practices and try to setup a minimal MEAN-stack-based application.

## Progress

All the steps I did to build this project can be found in the [steps.md](./steps.md) file.

## Contribution

Because the aim of this project is to learn, I will accept with joy contributions from other developer that are more skilled than me.

Please use GitHub Issues and Pull Request to contribute.
